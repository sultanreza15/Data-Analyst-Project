1. Project_Prediction Model
Background:
FinanKu is an imaginary fintech startup that provides savings and lending facilities to its customers. The services they offer include Savings Accounts, Time Deposits, Unsecured Loans, Credit Cards, and Vehicle Financing for Cars & Motorcycles.

Currently, FinanKu has approximately 20,000 customers spread across three major cities in Indonesia: Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya. This is a relatively significant number considering FinanKu has only been operating for 1.5 years, and it is projected that within the next three years their customer base will exceed 300,000.

This rapid growth has prompted stakeholders in FinanKu’s Credit Division to be increasingly cautious in disbursing credit facilities to avoid defaults, particularly from the Credit Card line, which offers an instant approval feature within 1 minute.

Problem Statement:
Over the past year, more than 20% of FinanKu’s credit card customers have defaulted on their payments. As a result, business operations have been disrupted, especially considering that FinanKu is still at an early-stage startup scale.

Business Objective:
FinanKu aims to identify lending customers who are likely to default as early as possible.

Analytical Objective:
To develop a Credit Card Default Prediction Model for FinanKu’s credit card facilities.


2. Project_Clustering Model
Background:
FundFusion, a banking institution in Wakanda, aims to enhance its marketing efforts toward both existing and potential customers. One of its marketing strategies is conducting phone-based campaigns, or telemarketing, where products are promoted directly through phone calls.
Currently, FundFusion does not have a clear strategy regarding which products should be offered when contacting prospective customers. Each account manager has different KPIs for customer acquisition based on the specific products offered by FundFusion, such as Savings Accounts, Time Deposits, Credit Cards, Home Loans, Vehicle Loans, or Personal Loans.
As a result, potential customers may receive multiple calls in a single day from different account managers offering different products. This leads to a high rejection rate and causes the calls to be perceived as spam, often resulting in the bank’s numbers being blocked.

Problem Statement:
There is no effective strategy for determining the most suitable product to offer based on the segment of the prospective customer being targeted.

Business Objective:
Increase the acquisition of new customers by offering the right product that aligns with the profile of the prospective customer being contacted.

Analytical Objective:
Develop a Clustering Model to identify product ownership patterns based on the demographic profiles of current FundFusion customers.
